        <p>Maximilian had Sports in his blood the day he was born.
            Both his mom and dad got him a hockey stick and a ball when he was only 5 years old.
            Which made trouble for the neighbors because of a 40% chance that Maximilian could hit a window
            and 60% chance that Maximilian can not hit a window, on most of the songs he plays a guitar and sometimes,
            he plays
            the Baritone, but,he hates carring both instruments. Also, he plays Ice Hockey with quick toes. Sidney
            Crosby
            has quick toes too, Maximilian has good skills with the puck, Sidney Crosby has good skills too, so,
            Maximilian is a:
            Hockey Star!
            Maximilian also has a sidekick, his name is Xavier "Xavier will be in the next website"
            Maximilian Said.
