    <h1>Playing A Concert</h1>
    <p>Playing a concert can be great fun! Or it can be totaly scary! Sometimes both at the same time.</p>
    <p>So we've put together a list of our top tips for great concerts</p>
    <h2>Write A Set list</h2>
    <p>A <strong>set-list</strong> is a list of all your songs in the order you'll play them</p>
    <p>Make copies for everyone</p>
    <p>Print it <strong>BIG</strong> so that you can still read if it if it's down by your feet on the floor, or if the
        lightning isn't very good.</p>
    <h2>Remember your spares</h2>
    <p>Some instuments have parts that need to be replaced if they wear out or break. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>guitar strings</li>
        <li> saxaphone and clarinet reeds</li>
        <li>drumsticks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Make a list of the spares you might need and you make sure you know where they are in an emergency</p>
    <h2>Plan where you'll be on stage</h2>
    <p>Before you start to set up your insturments, take a few minutes to decide where you'll all going to be.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Will the drums be center stage? Or off to one side</li>
        <li>Is there a power socket for the amplifiler if your guitar player stands on the right</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's much better to think about all this <strong>before</strong> you start setting up your insturments. It's
        really annoying if you have to start unpluging things and swapping places once you've begun to set things up!</p>
    <h2>Know where your going, know when your on</h2>
    <p>If you're playing a concert somewhere you've never beeb before, make sure you know where it is. Print out a map
        or set a GPS before you leave. There's nothing worse than being lost in a unfamiliar place a half hour before
        you're due to go onstage.</p>
    <p>And when you do arrive, the first thing you should do is<strong> find out what time you're on</strong>. Times
        often change. Ask whoever is running the event when you'll be on. Don't get caught off guard</p>
